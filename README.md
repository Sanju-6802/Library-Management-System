# Library-Management-System
This is a Library Management System which provides a user-friendly interface for librarians to manage various tasks related to library operations such as adding, updating, and deleting books, managing member records, handling book reservations, and generating reports.It is implemented using Python.
Features:

1)Book Management: Librarians can easily manage books by adding new books, updating book information, and deleting books from the library's collection. The system allows librarians to store relevant information about each book, such as title, author, genre, publication date, and availability status.

2)Member Management: The system enables librarians to manage member records, including adding new members, updating member information, and deleting members. Member information, such as name, contact details, and membership status, can be stored in the system for easy reference.

3)Reports Generation: The system generates various reports for librarians, such as a list of all books in the library, books that are currently reserved, overdue books, and member borrowing history. These reports help librarians to manage the library effectively and make informed decisions.

4)User Authentication: The system provides user authentication and authorization features to ensure that only authorized users, such as librarians, can access the system and perform operations. Users need to authenticate themselves with valid credentials before accessing the system.

The system is open-source and hosted on GitHub, allowing for collaboration and contributions from the community.
